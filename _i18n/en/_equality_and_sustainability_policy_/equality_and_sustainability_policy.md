# Introduction
SonoMicro is steadfast in its commitment to nurturing a work environment that is diverse, inclusive, and sustainable, where all employees are accorded respect and dignity. This Equality and Sustainability Policy delineates our strategy for guaranteeing equal opportunities, advancing sustainability, and exerting a positive influence on the environment and society.

We have established an equality and sustainability policy and work specifically according to the United Nations global goals. With cheaper and more accessible high-tech fluid flow measurement solutions, it becomes more cost-effective for companies to gather data on their resource usage. Which is the foundation for timely sustainability improvements, as per sub-goal 12.6, and also be a driving force for better resource utilization, goal 12.2. As per sub-goal 11.b, the measuring device facilitates cities to implement measurement systems that contribute to improved resource use, for example, by reducing waste due to more efficient system monitoring, especially in areas with poor groundwater status and weak infrastructure. We also work towards the UN's 9th goal "Innovation and Infrastructure", with accessible measurement solutions that identify improvement opportunities, industries are restructured to make them sustainable, resource utilization becomes more efficient, and each country increasingly adopts technology and environmentally friendly processes according to its ability.
